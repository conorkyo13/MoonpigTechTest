Used a TDD approach to testing.

In the event of the sizeid not being specified, I defaulted the size to "md" as "md" has a baseMultiplier of 1.

Implemented a MVC design model so the code can be easily modified/extented.

Didn't include my node_modules folder in the upload since the size was too big, if that is somehow a problem let me know.
